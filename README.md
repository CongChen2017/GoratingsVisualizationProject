### This is a visualization of Go game professional gamers' rating and game records. From the website, 3 different pages can be used for different purposes:

#### front page: overall rating of top players (choose from Top10, Top20 or Top50). Players Elo score, nationality can be visualized through bar chart and donut chart.

#### Player page: pick a player from drop down list and get more information about him. The line chart shows the trend of the player's Elo score through all his career. More players can be added into the line chart and compare with each other. The results of last 10 (20 or 30) games can be visualized through bar chart while opponent's name can be seen while mouse over.

#### team page: this is a page using historical data to predict national team fight results between China and S. Korea. After input a desired team size (how many players from each team), the bar graph displays the game record between players, while the summary table shows win, loss, tie based on historical data.
